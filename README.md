# Welcome to the simple-oauth-server project!

The goal of this project is to provide an OAuth Authentication & Authorization Backend for self-hosting. It's an alternative to the OAuth-Backends from big cloud-providers like AWS or Azure and the commercial ones like auth0.com.

In addition it's way simpler than other OpenSource solutions like Keycloak achieved by keeping the features focussed on OAuth.

## Target audiences
* Companies that need an Authorization Backend for their application & services without depending on commercial services like AWS or Azure.
* Companies that need a self-hosted Authorization Backend to ensure data-privacy.
* Application developers that want to test their applications with the different OAuth Flows. This project can be configured with a simple API that fits in your application's test suite.
